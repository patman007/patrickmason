## Question A (40% credit):

In CSS3, how would you select:

  - Every `<a>` element whose `href` attribute value begins with “https”.
  - Every `<a>` element whose `href` attribute value ends with “.pdf”.
  - Every `<a>` element whose `href` attribute value contains the substring “css”.

## Question B (30% credit):

What is the purpose of the z-index and how is it used? What possible values does the z-index take (e.g. one of those is "auto")?

### Feedback: this was an easy one, as you had to do a bit of research on w3schools and write. Marking this as not attempted.
