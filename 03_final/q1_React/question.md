### Question:

Where in a react component would you put a function 
that you only want to invoke when said component mounts?

Include class and functional component methods of doing this. If you don't recall, research it and provide working examples.

### Answer: skipped

Ok.  Look at componentDidMount function and its equivalent in the function based react components,
aka useEffect hook.
