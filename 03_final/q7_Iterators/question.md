### Question:

What are various iterator functions available in JavaScript (e.g. forEach)?  What would be your choice of an iterator function to loop over the elements of an object?  What would be your choice of an iterator for arrays? Provide simple examples with your brief comments?

### Answer:
### Iterator functions available in Javascript are forEach(), for..of, for in, .map(), .filter(), .find(), 
### .findIndex(), .reduce(), .every(), .lastIndex(), .indexOf()and .some(). 

### My choice to loop over the elements of an object would be a for of loop. The for-of is the most concise of the for loops
### and it works with using continue, break, and return. It is used mainly to loop over data values.

### My choice of iterator for arrays is forEach. A benefit of ForEach is the user does not need to declare indexing or value variables
### in the scope where it is contained. forEach iterator has overall time to run through the code compared to most of the other
### iterators listed above in the first answer. 


### For code examples please see the script.js file in the q7_Iterators folder.


### Feedback: where are the code examples of your favorite iterators?
