## being hidden as shown below as a recommended style.
.sr-only {
    position: absolute;
    left: -10000px;
    top: auto;
    width: 1px;
    height: 1px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

### Another way is the use of the CSS clip code that is visually hidden, but still readable by the screen readers.
{clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
clip-path: inset(50%);
height: 1px;
width: 1px;
margin: -1px;
overflow: hidden;
padding: 0;
position: absolute;}

### In addition, listed below are two methods to visually hide content and do not involve using screen readers at all. 
### In CSS you can use display:none or visibility:hidden, literal content can be set to 0 pixels
### for the width and height (width: 0px; height: 0px). Another way is to move visible content off the
### visible screen (Text-intent: -100000px) or make a hidden class in HTML and adapting it to the CSS
### to move off the screen (<div class="hidden">This text is hidden.</div>). Finally, the aria-hidden="true"
### can hide the content from assitive technology.
