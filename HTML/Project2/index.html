            Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. He is widely considered to be
            a brilliant businessman, as well as one of the greates tech visionaries of our time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story of his life is nothing short of fascinating. After dropping out of college,
            he started Apple with his friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>
            in 1976 at the age of 21. The duo gained wealth and fame a year later for the 
            <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_334638">Apple II</a>
            one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. This was followed by the very 
            successful Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI (graphical user interface). After being
            ousted of Apple in 1985, he went on to oversee the creation of two new companies: NeXT computer
            and <a href="https://www.pixar.com/">Pixar.</a> With the success of the movie Toy Story, Steve became a billionaire. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1997, Steve returned to Apple. Bill Gates and Microsoft dominated the computer industry,
            and Apple was on the brink of extinction. Nonetheless,
            <a href="http://answerguy.com/2011/10/07/steve-jobs-great-salesman-business-change/">Steve was a fantastic salesman</a>
            and used his business acumen to slowly bring the company back to profitability.
