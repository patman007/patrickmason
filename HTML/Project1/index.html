        <p>
            Hi there everyone! My name is <u>Jon Arbuckle</u>. I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives
            in Munice, Indiana. I am the proud owner of a cate named <strong>Garfield</strong> and a dog 
            named <strong>Odie</strong>. Garfield is a fat, lazy, and loves to eat, while Odie is a dog
            without a brain. Although my pets drive me <em>crazy</em>, I can't imagine life without them.
        </p>

        <p>
           I spend about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. 
           I have to make sure to buy all of Garfield's favorite foods, or else he'll get grumpy. This
           includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, past with marinara sauce,
           frozen pizzas, and <strong>lots and lots</strong> of lasangna. When I come home, Garfield usually attacks me and
           tries to eat everything in the grocery bag before I even have time to put it in the refrigerator.
           One time he ate everything that I bought in 30 seconds, and I had to go back to the store to buy 
           more food.<em> I wasn't happy about that</em>.  
        </p>
