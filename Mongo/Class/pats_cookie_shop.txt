1. In the shell, create a database called “mydatabase”. 

        use mydatabase

2. Create a collection called “coffee”.

        No specific command at this time

3. Within coffee, create an object that has name: "frappuccino" and size: "grande".

        db.coffee.insert({name: 'frappuccino', size: 'grande'})

4. Create another object that has name: “espresso” and size: “tall”.

        db.coffee.insert({name: 'espresso', size: 'tall'})

5. Create one more object that has name: “earl grey” and size: “grande”.

         db.coffee.insert({name: 'earl grey', size: 'grande'})

6. Now, select earl grey and update it to have another key value pair: temp: “hot”.

        db.coffee.update({name: 'earl grey'}, {$set: {temp: 'hot'}})

7. Update espresso to have the name “White Chocolate Mocha” instead.

        db.coffee.update({name: 'espresso'}, {$set: {name: 'White Chocolate Mocha'}})

8. Do a search. How do we find all drinks that have a size of grande?

        db.coffee.find({size: 'grande'})

9. How do we delete the first object from our collection that contains size: tall?

        db.coffee.deleteOne({size: 'tall'})

10. How do we delete the coffee collection?

        db.coffee.drop()

11. How do we delete the mydatabase database?

        make sure you are in the correct database:

            db

        THEN:

            db.dropDatabase()
