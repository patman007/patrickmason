### Question 12:

Please use your own simple words to describe what are cascading rules in CSS. Please keep it under 150 words. Full credit given to simple explanation in own words and not a copy and paste from the documentation ;-)

### Answer:
### Sort by Importance goes through declarations applied to a selector and determines 
### which has more importance over the other such as ids vs. classes. Sort by weight
### is where which styling has more weight than another style listed such as an inline 
### style sheet in the body HTML over an external style sheet. Sort by Specificity is
### where the more specific the CSS rule then it will win over a less specific rule such
### a style applied to class of p elements will not win over a id tag for one specific 
### p element. Sort by Order is where if two rules have the same specificy, values, 
### and properties then the one order listed earlier in the CSS stylesheet document will
### appear in the browser before an order listed later in the CSS stylesheet document.
