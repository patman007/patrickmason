### Answer: The mobile phone would have a default page grid layout column extra small
### ( less than 576 pixels) and would go across as one whole column on the webpage on the 
### mobile phone.The desktop computer would have the page grid layout column as 
### for the default as column medium (greater than or equal to 768 pixels) with four columns across
## the wepage. But if the user zoomed in on the webpage it would eventually make the 
### four columns go into one whole column across the webpage, like the default page grid of the
### mobile phone.
