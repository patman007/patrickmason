### When an object.method is run asynchronously (e.g. $http.get), what does its callback function do?

1. runs immediately alongside the method in a 2nd thread without waiting
1. runs it's code synchronously in order to complete the get method
1. waits and runs after the requested get method returns with data or error
1. asks the user what she wants to do

### Wrong Answer: Runs immediately alongside the method in a 2nd thread without waiting.

### Correct Answer:
### Waits and runs after the request get method returns with data or error.
